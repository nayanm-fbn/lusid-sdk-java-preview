# VendorModelRule

A rule that identifies the set of preferences to be used for a given library, model and instrument type.  There can be many such rules, though only the first found for a given combination would be used.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**supplier** | [**SupplierEnum**](#SupplierEnum) | The available values are: Lusid, RefinitivQps, RefinitivTracsWeb, VolMaster, IsdaCds, YieldBook, LusidCalc | 
**modelName** | **String** | The vendor library model name | 
**instrumentType** | **String** | The vendor library instrument type | 
**parameters** | **String** | THIS FIELD IS DEPRECATED - use ModelOptions  The set of opaque model parameters, provided as a Json object, that is a string object which will internally be converted to a dictionary of string to object.  Note that this is not intended as the final form of this object. It will be replaced with a more structured object as the set of parameters that are possible is  better understood. |  [optional]
**modelOptions** | [**ModelOptions**](ModelOptions.md) |  |  [optional]
**instrumentId** | **String** | This field should generally not be required. It indicates a specific case where there is a particular need to make a rule apply to only a single instrument  specified by an identifier on that instrument such as its LUID. One particular example would be to control the behaviour of a look-through portfolio scaling  methodology, such as where there is a mixture of indices and credit-debit portfolios where scaling on the sum of valuation would be deemed incorrectly for one  set but desired in general. |  [optional]
**addressKeyFilters** | [**List&lt;AddressKeyFilter&gt;**](AddressKeyFilter.md) | Condition for model selection. If a condition is satisfied the default model for valuation is overridden (for that instrument). |  [optional]
